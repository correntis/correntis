I am currently a third-year student at the <strong>Belarusian State Technological University</strong>, pursuing a degree in <strong>"Software of Information Technologies"</strong>. My academic journey has exposed me to a wide range of programming languages and technologies.
</p>

<p> 
Iâ€™m most passionate about backend development. In my projects, I work with <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>, <strong>Docker</strong>, <strong>Redis</strong>, <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>MS SQL Server</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong> and <strong>React</strong>. Currently, Iâ€™m particularly interested in diving deeper into microservices architecture, exploring tools such as <strong>Prometheus</strong>, <strong>Grafana</strong>, <strong>RabbitMQ</strong> and <strong>Kafka</strong>, while also continuing to enhance my expertise in <strong>ASP.NET Core</strong>.
